# addonpub - HRCS Addon Publish
 addonpub creates a .gma file with the folder created by addonmk by using gmad (a tool included with Garry's Mod), and grabs a 512x512 .jpeg from screenshots folder created by shotconv, and then publishes the .gma and .jpeg with gmpublish (a tool included with Garry's Mod). After the addon is done uploading, it automatically opens the addon page in your default browser
 
 Known issues:
-Does not print the upload progress in realtime.
