# addonmk - HRCS Addon Make
 addonmk creates a folder with the name of the map in my Garry's Mod directory, and moves the corresponding BSP and NAV file from the garrysmod\maps folder to the new folder. It also copies the thumbnail image created by shotconv into the maps folder. Does not create addon.json.
